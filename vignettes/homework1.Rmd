This package contains a function, `mult_ABx`, which takes two square matrices and a vector and multiplies them together using one of two methods described below.

For $A,B$ square matrices of the same dimensions and $x$ a conformable vector:

1.  $A(Bx)$, or the "fast" method. This method first multiplies the latter matrix $B$ with the vector, then left-multiplies the former matrix $A$. The speed of this method scales as a square of $n$.

2.  $(AB)x$, or the "slow" method. This method first multiplies the matrices, then the vector, and the computation speed scales cubically with the dimension $n$.

We can use microbenchmarking to demonstrate the differences in speed of the two methods. We can generate matrices and vectors with random entries, varying the dimensions to show how the methods scale.

```{r}
# Use bench package for microbenchmarking
# bench::press to press results over many dimensions
benchmarks <- bench::press(
  dims = seq(10, 100, by = 10),
  {
    A <- matrix(rnorm(dims^2), nrow = dims)
    B <- matrix(rnorm(dims^2), nrow = dims)
    x <- rnorm(dims)
    # bench::mark to do the actual benchmarking
    bench::mark("A(Bx)" = mult_ABx(A, B, x),
                "(AB)x" = mult_ABx(A, B, x, slow = TRUE)
    )
  }
)

# Plot the results with ggplot
library(ggplot2)
benchmarks <- benchmarks[, c("expression", "dims", "median")]
colnames(benchmarks) <- c("Method", "Dimensions", "CPUTime")
benchmarks$Method <- factor(benchmarks$Method, levels = c("A(Bx)", "(AB)x"))
ggplot(data = benchmarks, aes(x = Dimensions, y = CPUTime, color = Method)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Benchmarking Matrix/Vector Multiplication Methods",
       x = "Matrix/Vector Dimension",
       y = "Median Time",
       color = "Method") +
  bench::scale_y_bench_time(base = NULL) +
  theme_bw()
```

The comparison in the plot above demonstrates the asymptotic differences in computation time that we expected.
